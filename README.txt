Hellfire is now open source!

This is a SA:MP gamemode script that aims to contain as many features as possible,
whether a player likes deathmatching, role-playing, racing or just messing around
and having fun, Hellfire script should be the right place for everyone!



I try to keep the /scripts/ files as standalone as possible so they can be used in
other gamemode scripts with ease.


Feel free to fork and make your own edit! Keep in mind this code is all hot off
the press, not always usable and bugs need to be reported!



Enjoy :)
